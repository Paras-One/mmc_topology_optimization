# MMC-Based Topology Optimization for Crashworthiness Enhancement

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation and supporting files for performing topology optimization of thin-walled structures using the **Moving Morphable Components (MMC)** method. The optimization aims to improve **crashworthiness performance** by reducing peak crushing force while maintaining sufficient energy absorption.

## üöó Project Overview

This study leverages the MMC-based topology optimization approach to enhance the axial crushing performance of **thin-walled square and hexagonal tubes**. The algorithm systematically searches for optimal material layouts that maximize energy absorption and crash resistance under axial loads.

Key objectives include:

- Optimizing the internal topology using MMC-based design components.
- Verifying structural performance using **ABAQUS Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**.
- Comparing different cross-sectional shapes under equivalent constraints.
- Identifying trade-offs between weight, peak crushing force, and energy absorption.

## üìä Results Summary

### Optimized Square Tube:
- üîª **Weight Reduction:** 17.65%
- üîª **Peak Crushing Force Reduction:** 19.96%
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Energy Absorption Loss:** < 16.69%

### Optimized Hexagonal Tube (same mass as optimized square tube):
- üî∫ **Energy Absorption Increase:** 8.20%
- üî∫ **Peak Crushing Force Increase:** 8.64%

These findings demonstrate that optimized hexagonal configurations can outperform traditional square tubes in energy absorption with minor trade-offs.

## üß† Methodology

1. **MMC-Based Topology Optimization:**
   - Randomized initial component placement.
